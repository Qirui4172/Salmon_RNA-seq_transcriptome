# In-house scripts wrote for RNA-seq analysis of adherent cells from Salmon intestine and head kidney. It includes two scripts, "salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh" and "salmonDI_mRNA_part2.r".

# Running environment

# The script "salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh" was originally run in author's private work directory "/home2/park/salmonDI_mrna", raw fastq files were stored in directory "/home2/park/rawData/flowcell2_rna/fastqFiles", STAR index was build in directory "/home2/park/genome/star_index". Other users have to modify these THREE directory variables, "WorkDir", "RawReads", and "Index", in line5-7 of script to their own work directory for custom use. Adapter and barcode sequence are stored in "config.txt", other users also have to change to their own adapter sequence.

# The script "salmonDI_mRNA_part2.r" can be run directly in other users own directory, please keep the input files in the same directory.

#======================================================================================================
# Script1: salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh

# Usage: bash salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh -c config.txt -s3,4,5
#
#	Parameters
#	-c|--config	(required)	Configure file ("config.txt")
#	-s|--step	(optional)	Which step to run (see "Steps" and "Examples" below, by default run all steps)
#	-h|--help	(optional)	Return help information
#
#	Steps
#	1	Quality control of raw fastq
#	2	Trim adapter
#	3	Quality control of trimmed fastq
#	4	Align to salmon genome (ICSASG_v2)
#	5	Statistics of alignments
#	6	Generate readcounts matrix
#
#	Examples
#	bash salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh --config=config.txt --step=3,4,5 (or -c config.txt -s3,4,5)
#	bash salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh -c config.txt (if not mentioning steps, run all steps by default)
#	bash salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh -h (for help information)
#
#	Function
#	Analyze salmon DI RNA-seq data: quality control of raw fastq; trim adapter; quality control of trimmed fastq; align to genome; generate read counts matrix.

# NOTE:
# "config.txt" is a manually-prepared configure file that should be kept in the same directory with the script.

# Output:
# Clean reads are stored in ${WorkDir}/cleanReads/
# Alignments are stored in ${WorkDir}/alignment/
# Quality control results of raw reads, clean reads, and alignments are stored in corresponding subdirectories of ${WorkDir}/qualityControl/.
# "salmonDI_readcounts.matrix" is the newly generated raw read counts matrix of all 12 samples, which is to be used in the script "salmonDI_mRNA_part2.r".

#======================================================================================================
# Script2: salmonDI_mRNA_part2.r

# Usage: Rscript salmonDI_mRNA_part2.r <readCounts.mx> <sampleInfo> <readCounts/gene> <nonZeroLib/gene> <controlGroup> <adjPvalue> <foldChange> <ssaGeneName>
#
# Parameters (all required):
#	 <readCounts.mx>		Read counts matrix file ("salmonDI_mRNA_readcount.mx", generated from "salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh")
#	 <sampleInfo>			Sample information file ("sample.info")
#	 <readCounts/gene>		Minimal total read counts in all 12 libraries per gene, genes with read counts less than this number will be filtered out (suggest: 100)
#	 <nonZeroLib/gene>		Minimal non-zero libraries per gene, genes with non-zero libraries less than this number will be filtered out (suggest: 5)
#	 <controlGroup>			Control group, "DI" or "HK" (DI: distal intestine, HK: head kidney)
#	 <adjPvalue>			BH adjusted p value for running DESeq2 (suggest: 0.05)
#	 <foldChange>			Minimal fold change threshold for determining DEGs (suggest: 2)
#	 <ssaGeneName>			"ssa_geneName.list"
#
# Example:
# Rscript salmonDI_mRNA_part2.r salmonDI_mRNA_readcount.mx sample.info 100 5 DI 0.05 2 ssa_geneName.list
#
# Function: Run DESeq2, to find differentially expressed genes and generate plots.


# NOTE:
# "salmonDI_mRNA_readcount.mx" is the RAW read count matrix of mRNAs generated from "salmonDI_mRNA_part1.sh".
# "sample.info" is a manually-prepared sample information file.

# Output:
# "salmonDI_mRNA_baseMean.tsv" is the DESeq2-normalized read counts of all 12 samples.
# "salmonDI_mRNA_DEGlist.tsv" is the full list of DEGs with an absolute fold change > foldChange, and BH adjusted < adjPvalue.
# "salmonDI_mRNA_DEGplots.pdf" is the plot collection file, including sample correlation heatmap, PCA, MA plot, normalization dispersion estimate plot, DEG volcano plot, DEG heatmap.
